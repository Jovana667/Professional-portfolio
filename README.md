#Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my first professional portfolio apart of the Module 2 challenge designed to showcase my skills and talents. I have put this portfolio together with the goal in mind to present this to future employers.
In this challenge I have applied my newly learned knowledge of flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
